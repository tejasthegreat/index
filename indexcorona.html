                <p>Since the first U.S. case of the new coronavirus was reported on Jan. 20 in Washington state, more than 22.5 million people have been diagnosed. While the vaccines are starting to be administered throughout the country, it is likely to be some time before most Americans have access, and infections, hospitalizations and deaths are expected to increase.

Cases have been surging across the country. Leaders in New York and New Jersey have also signaled concern over rising caseloads in those former hotspots.</p>
